Hi Guys This is simple tutorial for setting your own remote git repository in cpanel 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisite : You should have basic understating of git , if you know how to commit , that much is fine :)



Although your case could be different , in our case default server port was set to 2200 , so we will follow along with that 

1. first of all, to create a git repo on server we should have knowledge of terminal and our hosting account should be accessible from terminal . To connect to our hosting account via terminal we use ssh command . i.e 

ssh username@abc.com , and then we are asked for our account password . 

2. After connecting to server successfully we use the command to create empty git repository on the server with the command 

	git init bare 

3. to clone our repository on our local linux machine we would use the command 

	git clone ssh://username@abc.com:portnumber/home/username/public_html/path/to/your/git_repository/developerRitesh.git

note: developerRitesh here refers to the empty repository that we created in 2nd step

4. after cloning our repository on local server 
	
	we could use git status 
	git commit 
	git add 
	git diff 

	and can add the changes to the site and push it again on live server

5. Uploading changes to remote repo 

	git remote add origin ssh://username@abc.com:2200/home/username/public_html/git_repository/developerRitesh.git
	git push -u origin master

	note : please use git diff before uploading your work to server , as another developer might be some commits ahead on you , which you would not be aware of. 


Well thats it
